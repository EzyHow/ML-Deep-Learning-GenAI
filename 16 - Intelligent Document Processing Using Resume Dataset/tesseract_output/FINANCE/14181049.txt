DIRECTOR FINANCE AND FP&A
Executive Profile
Tma senior finance leader who thrives when working closely with the executive team in removing obstacles to directing the company beyond
targeted growth. Early in my career I leamed the value of looking beyond how things are currently done in order to continually search for how we
can do things better. Working in cooperation with senior leadership throughout the organization, my finance tears are built with this focus and the
results are enhanced analytics and dynamic reporting took.
