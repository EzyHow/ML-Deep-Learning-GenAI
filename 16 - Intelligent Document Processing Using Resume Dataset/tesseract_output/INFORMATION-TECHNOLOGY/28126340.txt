Web Developer Jun 2003 to Current

Company Name As webmaster I was responsible for the wing-to-wing implementation of online solutions for small businesses using the full System
Development Life Cyck. All projects were delivered 100% on time, within budget by correctly assessing needs upfront, and gathering detailed
design specifications that prevent scope creep. I was directly involved in the design/develop/testing phases, the implementing of database systems
using Classic ASP/ASP.net 2.0 and MS SQL Server 2000/2005 in the Windows Hosting environment, PHP 4.0 - 5.0 and MySQL 4 in the Linux

Intranet Application Support Analyst Jan 2003 to Jul 2007

Company Name Key responsibilities were to manage the timeliness and accuracy of system parameter setups and data migration of files for private
label and bank card projects. Worked with fimetional areas such as Marketing, Risk, Fraud, Operations, and Collections to ensure that
parameters implemented met project requirements by serving as the IT lead responsible for overcoming any organizational and technical barriers
that arose. During this period I was able to successfully multi-task and manage several projects concurrently making my role key in the successfill
impknrniation of 14 new portfolios that had a combined growth of $1.26B in new receivables. Implemented successfiil business-wide initiatives
such as: Ovations! - An associates rewards and recognition system. Primary responsibility was to enhance the systems Graphical User Interface

peak usage periods. This was accomplished by managing the wing-to-wing project implementation with the selected outside vendor and internal IT
teams involved. Kronos TM Workforce Central - Key responsibility was to stabilize the application within the Windows 2k/Oracle 91
infrastructure by leveraging a test server for validating patches, and major version updates by the vendor. Once moved to the live production
environment, load balancing between 3 application and 1 database server was impkmented to better support peak usage times. This allowed the
system to always be available for users to accurately record their time and ensured the Human Resource department they were within 99%
compliance in handling employee payroll. Managed Offshore Resources during several key Intranet initiatives by assisting in the review and
approval of high-kvel and detail design of business requirements for the enhancerrents/mintenance of other miscellaneous web applications within
the scope of the Consumer Finance IT buikd team After the testing phase was complete I assured the hand off from the build to the production run
team was a seamess transition that did not interrupt any existing production processes. Initiated the role ofa technical support contact providing
mmintenance and enhancements for three integrated business tracking systems built with classic ASP and MS SQL used to manage the work flow
for a Portfolio Services department of 120 associates. Phases of the application were being built by members of the Information Management
Leadership Program (IMLP), each with specific requirements to implement within their six month rotation. These rotations left a support gap which
| filed to address any system issues as they rose. This resulted in a smoother transition between the IMLP members by allowing them time to focus
on and fulfilling their requirements of the program instead of immediately coming into a new rotation addressing issues keft by a previous colleague.
Iplemented a database migration plan from MS SQL Server 6.5 to 2000, which included maintenance schedules and archiving. By the structure
of the two versions MS SQL server being completely different, it had to be a two phased approach. Phase one required a migration from 6.5 to
7.0. Phase two was to migrate ffom7.0 to 2000. Since support was going to be dropped for MS SQL Server 6.5 the entire project had to be
compkted within 30 days. This migration allow me to implement a regularly scheduled maintenance plan that reduced end-user downtime from 10
- 20 hours per month to zero The Subject Matter Expert for the Mid-Range Application group in Stamford responsible for conducting a transfer of
knowledge from the Atlanta data management personnel back to the Mid-Range team for ongoing support. Due to the elimination of curtain
business fictions this process had to be successfully completed within 60 days to prevent the possibke impact of production systems there affer.
