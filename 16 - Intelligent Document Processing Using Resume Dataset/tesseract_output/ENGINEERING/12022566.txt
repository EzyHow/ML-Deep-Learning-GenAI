Accomplishments

© Manufacturing a 9 Volt battery with minimum process variability and cost of production Jan 2014 - April 2014 Designed statistical
experiment to derive significant factors in manufacturing a baking soda based 9V battery Analyzed the voltage readings to achieve 9'V with
litle variation possible by adjusting factors and at low cost using ANOVA, Fractional factorial, Central composite design, cost analysis, T-
tests, Path of steepest ascent Applied statistical process control tools to check whether the process is in-control Used Capability analysis to
compare actual process performance to the performance standards established by customers.
Impkmenting quality assurance tools like method of steepest ascent, response surface modelling, statistical process control, process
capability analysis to achieve the continuous production of consistent output 9V batteries Achieved results with minimum process variability
at least possible cost Supply Chain Management and Initiatives at AMUL Diary Sept 2013 - Dee 2013 Studied and analyzed the Supply
Chain of AMUL Daary and suggested improvements in their Supply Chain Managerent to maximize the profit Analyzed the rok of
information in the Supply Chain of AMUL diary such as EIAS,GIS, DISK Advantages of E- initiative Suggested financial implications such
as improve logistics transportation through integrated Railway system.
© Reduced transportation time by choosing the nearer sites in their expansion plans Improved distribution network in retail outkts,
supermarkets to increase reach Demand Forecast For Ellicott Food Court, Campus and Dining at University at Buffalo Sept 2013 - Dec
2013 Suggested improved forecasting techniques to reduce the wastage of food and maximize the profit Implementation of quantitative
forecasting techniques over EFC’S subjective forecasting technique Lean Approach in Manufacturing and Healthcare Industry Jan 2014 -
May2014 Studied and Analyzed the case related to manufacturing industry Toyota Mapped A3 affer analyzing the current issues, and
suggested improverments and implemented corrective measurements Applied samme approach in healthcare industry and brainstormed
benefits Identified challenges and suggested methods in streamline current process.
