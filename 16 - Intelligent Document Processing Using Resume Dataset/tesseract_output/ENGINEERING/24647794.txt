Accomplishments

IEEE Robot Competition Systems Design (CAPSTONE) Spring 2013 - spring 2014 Collaborated with a team of 4 engineering
students in the design and implementation ofan autonomous robot that has to detect an oil rig on “fire”, select and transport a specific tool in
order to extinguish the fire Lead the mechanical design of the robot; both chassis and robotic arm parts with 3-D printing technology and
SolidWorks software.

Acquired experience with the mechanical shop equipment and lab instruments while producing mechanical components and implementing
and assembling electrical circuits.

Acquired experience using the product development life cycle and risk assessment.

Gained experience in the integration of the hardware and software subsystems and the testing process of the design.

Competed in the 2014 IEEE Region V robotics competition.
