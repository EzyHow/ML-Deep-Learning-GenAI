© Worked witha team of four people in UCSD's MAE 3 chss to build a mobile robot.

* Evaluated parts of the robot using components such as springs, high-speed motor, and geared motor Analyzed and assessed progress of the
project by using a Gantt chart Directed the group in the areas of design process and concept generation Energy Analysis Determined the
mobility of the robot by estimating the energy and power transfer that occurs from the motor to the wheels of the robot Calculated the
torque on the wheel, friction force of the floor, and other values such as factor of safety and desired time of travel AutoCAD Software
