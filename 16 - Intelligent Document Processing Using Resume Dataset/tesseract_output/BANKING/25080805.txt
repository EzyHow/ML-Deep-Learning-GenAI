Titk: the relationship between the mathemntical grade of the seventh grade and grades from primary school.

Titk:bike rental prediction

Brief process: construct the regression model use different statistical method, find the most powerfiil model decided by finding the least error rate,
and decide which variables significantly enough to build the model.

Achieverrents from the project: use Lasso to make the regression, it gives the least error rate and use the almost original data set, it saves a lot of
time to deal with the original data set.
