Executive Profile

Tama self-motivated and patient focused nurse executive with a strong history of progressive leadership. I have worked in health care for the past
12 years and in nursing for the past 9. I have been honored to quickly and progressively build upon mry experiences to assume key leadership
positions. These opportunities have allowed me to lead the charge on increased facility efficiency and cost savings, while ensuring stellar quality
programming with a focus on infection control, risk management, and quality improvement. Under my direction, organizational improverrents in
those areas have flourished while experiencing record surgical volurre and implementation of new and innovative procedures. Change under
pressure has been staple in my professional life, and an aspect that has quickly molded me in to a quick-witted yet carefil professional; always
putting the patient first, but never losing sight of strategic goals to ensure organizational success.
