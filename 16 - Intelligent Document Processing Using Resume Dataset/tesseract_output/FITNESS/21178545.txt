EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT PHYSICIAN
Herlieceers RST risa

I intend to practice general endocrinology; however I am pursuing additional training in the area of obesity medicine and hope to bring this
expertise to the practice I join. My background in nutrition science and exercise, as well as my clinical experience in weight management and
bariatric clinics, and research endeavors in clinical weight loss trials will enable me to develop the skills I need to supervise and direct patients in

their weight loss efforts. I am open to working in both the inpatient and outpatient setting as my fellowship traning has equipped me to manage
inpatient diabetes and endocrine consults.
