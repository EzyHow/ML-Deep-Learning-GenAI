Company Name Maintenance Engineer Intem

© Investigated operations and maintenance problems of Heat Exchangers and Reffigerators Monitored, Analyzed and Initiated actions for
increasing efficiency of operation Studied P&ID's, Wiring Diagrams and Manuals and recommended economic maintenance solutions
Developed prototype ofa heat exchanger with an integrated hydrophobic coating that costed $10 per foot Succeeded in increasing the
condensation rate by 27%, making it more environment friendly Proposed a model that was 21% compact and 22% (S18k) less expensive,
that performs equally well in comparison with present heat exchangers Submitted a report with scope for improverment in innovative design
