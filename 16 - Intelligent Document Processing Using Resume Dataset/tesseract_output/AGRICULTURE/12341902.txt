T joined the Ministry of Education in 1982 and was posted at the R.M. Bailey Senior High School where I remained for seventeen and a half

counselors in 1999 to one hundred and thirty two (132) in 2015, posted in ninety-four schools on fourteen islands and cays throughout the
country. During my keadership, we collaborated with the College of The Bahams and Kent State University and established a Master's of
Education Degree Program in Schoo! Counseling from 2001 to 2011. Eighty- nine (89) persons obtained the Masters Degree, and the unit has the
largest amount of employees with this Degree in the Ministry of Education. I realized in order for the unit to move forward, ongoing training was a
requirement for all officers, which kept them informed about the latest techniques and strengthened areas of concem. We ako established a crisis
team that assists with griefand disaster counseling.

The needs of students were being met but those of the employees were not and after visiting the school district in Dallas Texas, I learned about the
Enplyee Assistance Program, and implemented it at the Ministry of Education ona smalkr scale. This proved to be very successfil but the need
for expansion was necessary. Upon the retirement of Mrs. Pansy Hamilton Brown, Iris Strachan, and Clevette Gibson took the reins and took
EAP to the next level. The demands on the officers mde me realize that the service needed to be made availabk to all government employees and
the idea to expand the service was decided. I enjoyed my role as Senior Education Officer and if given the opportunity would like to be a part of
taking EAP to the next level
