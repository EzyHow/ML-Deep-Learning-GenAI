* Focused on production, purification and structure-finction studies of multi-fimctional therapeutic peptides with Inmunomoduhtory, anti-
inflammation, anti-hypertension, anti-oxidation and anti-microbial effects.

Analyzed different enzymes/proteins as single molecules or as members ofa network (.g.

signaling pathway), and their therapeutic/mdustrial applications.

Developed the methods and conducted research on process optimization, product formulation, protein engineering, and QSAR studies, in
artificial neural network, response surface modeling and other statistical methods.

Designed and established new protein, peptide, and enzyme analytical methods and assay systems.

Constructed gene cloning and different expression systems, and engineered the enzymes structures and fictions.

Studied the ADME of therapeutic molecules in vitro / in vivo, and developed different strategies for their delivery.

Supervised 6 PhD, 5 MSc and 7 BSc students on muttipke research projects.

Taught university level courses in biochemistry and biophysics.

Served as the lead on the bioactive peptides and fictional molecules research team with over 22 members.

Completed 4 research projects on study of therapeutic peptides and biofinctional molecules, which led to the development of over 60 novel
